pmhpereira's [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) solutions
====================================

The bundled `solution.bat` file allows to easily run a specific solution of a solved problem.

> **Usage:** solution <# problem>

**Note:** `solution.bat` runs on _Windows_ and needs _Node.js_ to be installed on PATH.


### Folder Hierarchy
The `/solutions` folder contains one folder for each solved problem, numbered with the id of the problem.
Each solution folder contains a `<#problem>.js` file with the solution to that problem.
A solution folder might contain multiple solutions for the same problem. In this case, the `<#problem>.js` will contain the fastest/latest one.
